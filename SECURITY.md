| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The log4j2-log4Rich team takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@log4rich.com] (if available)
2. **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact project maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability**: Buffer overflow, injection, authentication bypass, etc.
- **Component affected**: Which part of the bridge is affected
- **Attack scenario**: How the vulnerability could be exploited
- **Impact assessment**: What could an attacker accomplish
- **Reproduction steps**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of concept**: If available, a minimal example demonstrating the issue
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for how to resolve the issue

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week of initial response
- **Fix Development**: Depends on complexity, typically 1-4 weeks
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and users have time to update

### Coordination

We will work with you to:

- Confirm the vulnerability and assess its impact
- Develop and test a fix
- Plan the disclosure timeline
- Credit you appropriately (if desired)

## Security Considerations

### Architecture Security

The log4j2-log4Rich bridge is designed with security in mind:

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **No Code Execution**: The bridge does not execute user-provided code
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Simple delegation pattern reduces complexity
- **Dependency Management**: Careful selection and monitoring of dependencies

### Common Security Best Practices

When using the log4j2-log4Rich bridge:

#### 1. Avoid Logging Sensitive Information

```java
// DON'T log sensitive data
logger.info("User password: {}", password);
logger.debug("Credit card: {}", creditCardNumber);

// DO log only necessary information
logger.info("User {} authenticated successfully", username);
logger.debug("Payment processed for user {}", userId);
```

#### 2. Validate Log Inputs

```java
// Validate inputs before logging
public void logUserAction(String action, String userId) {
    if (action != null && userId != null) {
        // Sanitize inputs if needed
        String sanitizedAction = sanitizeForLogging(action);
        logger.info("User {} performed action: {}", userId, sanitizedAction);
    }
}
```

#### 3. Control Log Output

```properties
# Configure appropriate log levels for production
log4rich.level=WARN

# Avoid verbose logging in production
log4rich.logger.com.myapp.sensitive=ERROR
```

#### 4. Secure Log Storage

- Ensure log files have appropriate file permissions
- Consider encrypting sensitive log data
- Implement log rotation and secure archival
- Monitor log access and modifications

### Known Security Considerations

#### 1. Log Injection

**Risk**: User input in log messages could potentially be used for log injection attacks.

**Mitigation**: The bridge uses parameterized logging which helps prevent log injection:

```java
// Safe parameterized logging
logger.info("User {} logged in from {}", username, ipAddress);

// Avoid string concatenation
// logger.info("User " + username + " logged in from " + ipAddress);
```

#### 2. Information Disclosure

**Risk**: Accidentally logging sensitive information.

**Mitigation**: 
- Train developers on secure logging practices
- Use appropriate log levels
- Implement log message sanitization if needed

#### 3. Denial of Service

**Risk**: Excessive logging could consume system resources.

**Mitigation**:
- Configure appropriate log levels
- Use log4Rich's performance features
- Monitor system resources

#### 4. Configuration Security

**Risk**: Insecure log configuration could expose sensitive data.

**Mitigation**:
- Secure configuration files
- Use appropriate file permissions
- Avoid logging to world-readable locations

### Dependency Security

#### log4Rich Dependency

The bridge depends on log4Rich. Security considerations:

- **Version Management**: Keep log4Rich updated to latest secure version
- **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Monitor log4Rich security advisories
- **Isolation**: The bridge provides isolation between application and log4Rich

#### Build Dependencies

Development and build dependencies:

```xml
<!-- Test dependencies are not included in runtime -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Security Testing

We perform regular security testing including:

- **Static Analysis**: Code analysis for common vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Monitoring dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation Testing**: Testing with malicious inputs
- **Performance Testing**: Ensuring no DoS vulnerabilities

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- **Prioritized**: Security fixes take priority over feature development
- **Backwards Compatible**: Security fixes maintain API compatibility when possible
- **Well Documented**: Clear description of vulnerability and fix
- **Quickly Released**: Fast-track release process for security fixes

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Notification**: Vulnerabilities reported privately to maintainers
2. **Assessment Period**: Time to assess and develop fixes
3. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Public disclosure after fixes are available
4. **Credit**: Appropriate credit to security researchers (if desired)
